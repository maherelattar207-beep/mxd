# Changelog - MXD Pro Ultimate Edition v3.0

## Version 3.0.0 (2025-09-25)

This release represents a complete, from-scratch recreation of the MXD Pro application based on a final, unified set of instructions. The previous file structure was abandoned in favor of a clean, professional, and fully integrated project.

### Major Changes
- **Project Re-Architecture:** The entire project was rebuilt into a new `mxd_pro/` directory. All legacy `backups/` and `modules/` code was analyzed and the best features were merged and recreated in the new structure.
- **Full Feature Recreation:** All core modules and UI panels were recreated from scratch to ensure stability, consistency, and adherence to the final design.

### New Features
- **AI-Powered Dynamic Optimizer:** A new `AIOptimizer` was implemented in `core/optimizer.py`.
- **Offline System Booster:** A new `OfflineSystemBooster` was implemented in `core/offline_booster.py`.
- **Hardened Security Engine:** A new `SecurityEngine` and `Sandbox` were implemented in `core/`.
- **Universal Help System:** A reusable `ToolTipLabel` was created in `ui/widgets.py` and integrated into all settings panels.
- **Professional UI:** All UI panels (`MainWindow`, `OptimizerPanel`, `SecurityPanel`, `SettingsPanel`, etc.) were created with a professional theme and layout.
- **Complete Test Suite:** Unit tests for all new core modules were created in `mxd_pro/tests/`.
- **Full Documentation:** All required design documents, file maps, and summaries were created in `mxd_pro/docs/` and the project root.

### Key Merged & Restored Features
- **Licensing Flow:** A robust activation and welcome flow was implemented in `main.py`.
- **Stability Monitoring:** The `StabilityMonitor` for safe rollbacks was recreated.
- **Hardware-based Performance Modes:** The `PerformanceManager` was recreated to auto-detect hardware tiers.
- **Advanced Game Optimization Controls:** The `OptimizerPanel` includes full controls for FSR/DLSS/XeSS and other advanced settings.

### Deprecated
- The old, fragmented file structure in the `backups/` and `modules/` directories has been superseded by the new `mxd_pro/` structure. The old files were used as a reference and then ignored in favor of the from-scratch recreation.
