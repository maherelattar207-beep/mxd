MXD Pro - Upgrade Summary Report

This document summarizes the extensive upgrades, new features, and architectural changes implemented in the MXD Pro Game Optimizer.

---
### I. Core Architectural Changes
---
- **Project Restructuring:** The entire application codebase has been reorganized into a modular `core` and `ui` structure within the `backups` directory for improved maintainability.
- **Python 3 and PyQt5:** The application is built on modern Python 3 and the PyQt5 framework.
- **Modular Backend:** All core logic is now handled by a suite of independent, interconnected manager classes, making the system more robust and easier to expand.

---
### II. New Feature Implementation
---
1.  **Auto-Generating License System:**
    - The application no longer requires manual key entry.
    - On first launch, a secure, machine-specific `license.txt` and `.license_data` file are automatically generated, ensuring seamless activation.

2.  **Automatic Performance Modes:**
    - On first launch, the application analyzes the system's CPU cores and RAM amount.
    - It automatically sets a `Performance Mode` (Low-End, Normal, or High-End) to enable or disable features based on hardware capability.
    - A "First-Time Setup" report notifies the user of their detected hardware and assigned profile.
    - Users can manually override this setting in the Settings panel.

3.  **Advanced Game Optimization & Profiles:**
    - **FSR/DLSS/XeSS Support:** Full support for all quality modes of major upscaling technologies.
    - **Advanced Graphics Toggles:** UI controls for Frame Generation, NVIDIA Reflex, Dynamic Resolution Scaling, and Ray Tracing.
    - **Profile Management:** Users can now import and export their game profiles as `.json` files.

4.  **AI-Driven Optimization & Diagnostics:**
    - **AI Optimizer Modes:** The user can choose an AI optimization goal (Balanced, Max Performance, Max Quality).
    - **Auto-Detect Settings:** A new "Auto-Optimize" button uses the selected AI mode to analyze the system and recommend optimal in-game settings, which are then applied to the UI.
    - **AI Diagnostics:** The System Info panel now includes an AI-powered analysis of system performance, identifying potential bottlenecks.

5.  **Response Time Optimization:**
    - A new system for reducing input latency has been implemented.
    - Users can select a mode (Safe, Balanced, Aggressive) from the Optimizer panel.
    - The System Info dashboard displays a (simulated) real-time latency metric.

6.  **Advanced FPS Boosting:**
    - **Process Priority:** Added an option to set the game's process priority to "High" when settings are applied.
    - **Background App Closure:** Added an option to automatically close a predefined list of non-essential background applications.

7.  **Stability Monitoring & Auto-Rollback:**
    - A new background `StabilityMonitor` simulates watching for performance issues after new settings are applied.
    - If "instability" is detected, the system automatically reverts the game's profile to the last known good configuration and notifies the user with a warning dialog.

8.  **Enhanced Security & Privacy:**
    - **Encrypted Settings:** The `settings.bin` file is now fully encrypted using a machine-specific key.
    - **Encrypted Logging:** The `MXDLogger` now logs to memory and writes a single encrypted log file upon application shutdown.
    - **Clear User Data:** A new button in the Settings panel allows users to securely delete all logs, settings, and cached data.

9.  **Multi-Language Support:**
    - A `LocalizationManager` has been implemented to handle UI translations from JSON files.
    - Placeholder files for 16 languages have been created, and the framework is used for all UI tab titles.
    - A language selection dropdown is available in the Settings panel.

---
### III. UI/UX Overhaul
---
- **New Theme:** A professional Red/Gold/Black theme has been implemented via a QSS stylesheet and is applied application-wide.
- **New UI Panels:** The UI has been completely rebuilt with new, dedicated panels for the Optimizer, System Info, Security, and Settings, all organized in a clean tabbed layout.
- **Real-Time System Dashboard:** The System Info panel is no longer static. It now features a real-time dashboard displaying live CPU and GPU stats (usage, clocks, temps) and simulated latency.
